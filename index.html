    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>At NotifyHub, safeguarding your privacy is our top priority. This document explains in clear terms how we handle your personal information within our application.</h2>

    <h3>Saving Notifications</h3>
    <p>We want to assure you that we do not retain any notifications or user data on our servers. When you use the "NotifyHub" application, incoming notifications are saved directly on your device. These notifications are stored locally and can only be accessed on the specific device where the application is installed. Rest assured that your notifications remain confidential and are not transmitted to any external servers.</p>

    <h3>Storage</h3>
    <p>In order to preserve notifications and associated media, our application requests access to your device's storage. It's essential to understand that this permission is exclusively utilized for the purpose of storing pertinent data. We want to reassure you that our application abstains from accessing any files or data unrelated to its fundamental functionality.</p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>To enhance the quality of our service, our application collaborates with various third-party providers. These providers independently gather their own data. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies to ensure your comfort with their data collection practices.</p>

    <h3>Advertising</h3>
